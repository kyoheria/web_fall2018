          <h1>Concept:</h1>
          <p>many weather app that exists in this world is heavily depended on the text and word. Using Open Weather Map, I wanted to create a page that shows the weather of a specific area as an environment that all pieces of information are linked to elements as color and movement.</p>

          <h1>User Testing:</h1>
          <p>1.What do you think this project is about?

          <p> a. I like how you are trying to give information in the different way than usual weather app. The stylised web is relaxing to watch so it might work as interactive screensaver.  

          <p> b. I think it is cool that once you get used to which element is representing specific information, you can get all the info you need without depending on the words or number.  

          <p> c. Weather app  

          <p> d. It’s a environment? Weather?  

          <p> e. Weather App / Weather website

          <p>2. Do you think there is enough information on this project? 

          <p> a. I think you should add units so it is easier to read.

          <p> b. Yes there is enough in weather wise and also on how to use the website.

          <p> c. It is perfect amount of information visually, there are enough to understand what is going on and not too much that make me go crazy. 

          <p> d. Most of the thing make sense.

          <p> e. Yes. clear that what is going on 

          <p> 3.what is one thing you want to see on this project?

          <p> a. I would love if the sun/moon was moving according to the true position in nature  

          <p> b. I want to see a character or something that lives in the environment  

          <p> c. (he is in Japan) I wish to see time difference!! That would be fun to have!! To know the weather in the other parts of the world! 

          <p> d. Be able to change C to F 

          <p> e. I would add a character of user’s choice so that it looks like they live in there. Bacusethe it looks like in front of your garden 

          <p> 4. what do you not like about project?

 I do not like how you used a default typography even though all other part is so stylised 

 I don’t like that we can not customize anything on the web page 

 There are no much user interaction in here. I wish I was able to interact with more things. 

I don’t like the typography, it’s too small for me 

Typography ( it is sharp, it match in the way but it is hard to read) 

what is the one thing you like about this page? 

 I like how the environment has a consistency 

 I like the moving elements. It makes the webpage so much more interesting.

 I like the idea of changing the ways to present the such a basic information like weather in the different format.

It’s color is nice.

 Grass moving. 

what is one thing you would change about this project? 

 I would stylize everything (typography and all the colors) 

 I would make a mode that you can make your own environment. 

 Color of the red when you are showing the connection 

I would make type more bigger 

Typography  

what are you confuse about this project? 

I’m just little confused about information because there is no units 

I’m just confused why you chose red. 

I think it is little hard to see the red line of the grass that is mapped to the humidity. 

What visuality does 

Why is it turning red,  maybe you can change the text clot to the same color 

does matching of information and visualization make sense to you?

 I think most of thing make sence and also clever and unique way to show the weather without being too wordy 

 I does for most of the part 

 I think all the information is mapped to the element that naturally make sense 

 Yes it does and I think it’s very natural for the environment 

 When color change, if temperature change red look really hot so maybe change the tint of color. 

If you were me what kind of user interaction would you add to the project?

 I would make click to the hover, or add be able to hover over the element 

I would make a mode that you can make your own environment.  

I would add music to represent the atmosphere.  

I would make it able to add more element. 

Be able to interact with wind speed and other element. Also changing the position of the information so it is more easy to reach 

Do you have any question?

Not really.

Where did you get that font?

Why you made this? 

How about the time difference?  

Does the sun move? What is Clear (weather)? </p>





<p> I did change some of the parts throughout the user testing, and I learned that many people need different things like my mom wants bigger fonts and Sky don’t like the font but other classmate liked the font. Overall I am just so glad that people were able to make a connection of information and elements but it does take a little while for them to get that part. I might be able to come up with a different color or something else to show that connection when they click on the button. If I can technically can, I would love to make it possible to have information show up when they hover over the elements, but I am not able to do that with my ability right now, I think I gonna leave that for the future. I think putting character is an amazing idea it might require different library like p5.play but I think It gonna add more elements for the user to play with and I could keep on playing my style and also be able to add a customizable element by making user chooses the character. The sound that was mention could be a fun element to add. It could be a representation of some information or interactive part. I think I just started this project as for fun thing to do to get more comfortable to use API but it might hold more possibility to become some interactive environment that is relaxing.
